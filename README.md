## Features

<hr/>
Peak is a health tracking website that strives to bring users closer to their fitness goals with a long-term mindset.

- Keep track of when you've gone to the gym with the attendance tracker. Visually tracks when you've uploaded a workout to the app and keeps track of your streaks.
- Workout journal to keep track of your workouts (exercise, sets, reps) for the entire year.
- Calculate your calories through our tracker that lets you input custom meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- Find motivation through accountability groups, where anyone can join up with friends and have their workouts automatically sent to the group.
- Gain achievements through challenges to push motivation and show off by displaying them on your personal profile.
